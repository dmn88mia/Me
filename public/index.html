<p> Student Programmer by day and night! I am David Navarro from Miami, FL. My friends call me by the name Varro which is short for my last name. I have been coding since January 2015. Currenlty I am learning programming languages at Wyncode. Coding has become new favorite hobby that consumes most my day. I couldn't be happier doing anything else. Coding is fun, I encourage you to test it out and see where it takes you. It is a bit challenging.</p></div>
<p>Programming skills: (  Ruby, HTML, JavaScript, CSS  )</p>
